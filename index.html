							<h4>Website Programming (NSCC - Completed 2011)</h4>
							<p class="content-section__content">The Website Programming concentration at NSCC was my first glimpse of college life. Here the groundwork was laid for my IT skills. We started with basic networking and hardware, learned our first programming languages (Visual Basic and Java), and expanding into PHP, WordPress and database management.</p>
							<p class="content-section__content">When it came time to pick a concentration, my mind had already been made up on pursuing Website Programming. I liked the visual aspect of it, I liked the coding, and at the time I didn't have too much interest in the networking side of things.</p>
							<p class="content-section__content">Thinking back on the different projects and assigments we worked on, I think the most notable was a data-driven management system for work terms. We created a database, created HTML forms tied down with PHP to accept, edit, and delete data. The intention was to have this be the tracking system for all future work terms at NSCC, as at the time of creation, they were not tracked outside of a per-class basis.</p>

							<h4>Systems and Network Management (NSCC - Completed 2017)</h4>
							<p class="content-section__content">As I got a bit older, I noticed I was missing something from my IT education, which was the more physical side of things. With that in mind, I decided to attend NSCC a second time to flesh out the "missing half" of my skills. As I was getting a bit older, I set myself some goals:
								<ul>
									<li>I will not challenge any course, taking them all from scratch,</li>
									<li>I will get a full time job out of college for this field,</li>
									<li>I will graduate with honours, and</li>
									<li>I will try my best to achieve highest academic standing.</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							<p class="content-section__content">The first portion of this program was fairly simple. As I decided to not challenge any courses, meaning to prove my skills and use the credit from my previous diploma, it was easy sailing. This gave me an opportunity to pick up on subtle details I missed the first time around, like when you watch a movie for a second time, you always find bits and pieces that were hidden by the larger parts front and centre.</p>
							<p class="content-section__content">With newfound focus, I tackled my new courses diligently learning networking, security, server management, active directory, and even picking up a new programming language (Python). I used a self directed course to brush up on my Java skills, and managed to accomplish all of the goals I had set for myself, especially attaining honours, highest academic standing, and landing a job straight out of my work term with CSC as a DNS Specialist (modern title was changed to Technical Product Support Coordinator).</p>

								<h3>2017 - DNS Specialist (CSC)</h3>
								<p class="content-section__content">
									Having finished my Systems and Network Management program, having a chance to apply that knowledge in a real world scenario was very refreshing. Serving as a DNS Specialist (title later changed to Technical Product Support Coordinator), I got to learn a lot about DNS, various security products like digital certificates and multi-factor authentication (MFA), and how integral Microsoft Excel can be to any organization.
								</p>
							</article>
							<article>
								<h4>DNS</h4>
								<p>
									Working through proprietary scripts and systems, I managed corporate zone files for large corporations with the utmost accuracy. With how important DNS is, there was no room for error, regardless of if I was changing one record, or 5000. Servicing clients doesn't have a curfew, so participating in a 24/7 on-call rotation ensured that all clients got the service they needed, when they needed it.
								</p>
								<ul class="work-section skills">
									<li class="skill skill--dns">DNS</li>
									<li class="skill skill--excel">Excel</li>
								</ul>
							</article>
							<article>
								<h4>Security Products</h4>
								<p>
									Working hand-in-hand with DNS was several security products such as digital certificates and MFA.
								</p>
								<p>CSC had partnerships with some industry leading certificate authorities, prompting a lot of relationship building between organization contacts to ensure clients got their certificates in a timely manner. Adding the requisite zone records for validation, and keeping emaculate client portfolios was key to mitigating any slow down in service, as some certificate types like extended validation can take weeks to complete.</p>
								<p>Working with MFA involved regularly scheduled cleanups of accounts to prevent stale users from remaining in the system for long periods of time. Although this process was manual in some capacity, there were other aspects that we had semi-automated to speed up processing of orders.</p>

									<li class="skill skill--digital-certificates">Digital Certificates</li>
									<li class="skill skill--mfa">MFA</li>
									<li class="skill skill--excel">Excel</li>
								</ul>
							</article>
							<article>
								<h4>Excel</h4>
								<p>
									Although Excel has been mentioned a few times throughout this section of my work experience, it was truly the bricks and mortar to all of the essential aspects of being a DNS Specialist. Dealing with big data on a regular basis meant that there was no alternative to being fluent in Excel and it's mandatory functions like pivot tables and vlookups. There were several automation tools we built in Excel, from zone record checkers, to traffic reporting, and even script builders.
								</p>

									<li class="skill skill--excel">Excel</li>
								</ul>

								<h3>2020 - Global Trainer (CSC)</h3>
								<p class="content-section__content">
									Sparked by my passion for learning, and subsequently mentoring, I opted to jump from a DNS Specialist to a Global Trainer. As a Global Trainer, it was my responsibility to plan, coordinate, create, launch, maintain and report on the organization's eLearning modules.
								</p>
							</article>
							<article>
								<h4>eLearning</h4>
								<p>
									The creation of eLearning modules was done in the Articlate 360 Suite of programs, specifically Storyline 360. Coming from such a technical position, my skills were not wasted as we were migrating our main system into a new overhauled system, which of course needed a full selection of interactive, gamified assessments. Using Storyline, I created my simulations using my PhotoShop skills along with prior programming experience, which made it much easier to manage Stroyline's variable features for advanced functionality. Topping it off with written course companions, voiceovers, and captioning for the hearing impaired, it was a full delivery of learning for all.

									<li class="skill skill--photoshop">PhotoShop</li>
									<li class="skill skill--audacity">Audacity</li>
								</ul>
							</article>
							<article>
								<h4>Video Learning</h4>
								<p>
									Sometimes an eLearning module would be overkill for a piece of learning content, and so this is where video production became relevant. During my time, I created a few videos detailing the basics of the Internet functionality, and created a talk-show-style series to better educate the front-line employees on digital certificates, partnered with one of my old team memebers who was at the forefront of the certificate products.

									<li class="skill skill--audacity">Audacity</li>
								</ul>
							</article>
							<article>
								<h4>LMS</h4>
								<p>
									All of the learning we created was uploaded to an LMS, where we would track progress, completion and scores for all assessments. Correctly organizing modules and setting the correct parameters ensured a smooth learning experience for all staff, and accurate reporting of course and assessment completion. This data was also used to contact various leadership teams to notify completion statistics.

								<h3>2021 - Software Dev. (resulta)</h3>
								<p class="content-section__content">
									Throughout my recent experience, I've spent a lot of time creating
									responsive and elegant web applications using WordPress and
									Advanced Custom Fields (ACF), and creating flexible and reusable
									templates with Timber and Twig. I have also created some
									management systems for product managers, all of which adhering to
									agile development cycles and version control.
								</p>
							</article>
							<article>
								<h4>Hosting Canada</h4>
								<p>
									Hosting Canada is a hosting review website, which compiles and
									categorizes the details and benefits of many hosting
									providers, helping users to find the perfect hosting provider.
								</p>
								<p>
									Learning the basics of regular expressions was pivotal while
									working with Hosting Canada. Using that knowledge, I was able
									to create a completely automated Table of Contents system.
									Paired with ACF, the product manager could turn on a table of
									contents on any page or post with one click, and even
									customize the headings in the table of contents should the
									automatically generated title not suit their needs.

								<h4>Crypto Vantage</h4>
								<p>
									Crypto Vantage serves as a knowledge base for all things
									cryptocurrency. Ranging in content from beginner friendly
									articles to digital wallets and buying guides, they ensure
									you're up to date with the fluidity of the crypto market.
								</p>
								<p>
									Most recently CryptoVantage was undergoing an evolution of its
									home page design. As part of that effort, I created a new
									component that elegantly allowed you to switch between several
									different categories. Each category showing a collection of
									hand-picked CTAs, chosen and customizable by the product
									manager. This component took up a lot of space, and so
									ensuring that animations were smooth during mobile-first
									development was key to a consistent experience.
								</p>
								<ul class="work-section skills">
									<li class="skill skill--wordpress">WordPress</li>
									<li class="skill skill--php">PHP</li>

								<h4>American Marijuana</h4>
								<p>
									American Marijuana boasts many articles pertaining to a wide
									variety of marijuana-based products such as CBD, Cannabis, and
									accessories. Some articles are even backed by medical
									professionals to ensure scientific accuracy.
								</p>
								<p>
									There is a robust tagging system in place for American
									Marijuana, categorizing a wide range of posts, compenets, etc.
									Using this tagging system, I built an Ad Management dashboard
									in the back-end of the site. The product manager was able to
									collect the ad scripts from the ad company, and simply paste
									them into the system. The tagging functionality allowed the
									product manager to add as many tags as they wished,
									associating specific scripts with that tag and ad size, which
									allowed extensive customization in ads and ad placement with
									little work.
